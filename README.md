A keylogger is a program that captures and records keystrokes made on a keyboard. While keyloggers can be used for valid purposes, like monitoring system activity, debugging applications, or helping with usability testing, they can also be misused for unauthorized data collection. This makes their use a sensitive subject.

Basic Functionality of a Keylogger
- Capturing Keystrokes. The program continuously listens for user input and records each key pressed.
- Storing Data. The captured keystrokes are saved in a log file, which can be accessed later.
- Optional Features. Some keyloggers may track timestamps, application usage, or even mouse activity.

Ethical Uses
- Parental Control. Monitoring children's online activity.
- Security Audits. Examining keyboard interactions in secure environments.
- User Testing. Observing typing patterns to improve software.

Since keyloggers can invade privacy and security, their use should always follow ethical and legal guidelines. Would you like to discuss keyboard event logging in Linux or Windows for legitimate cases?
